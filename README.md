# Rosetta Code : SAS Solutions Corpus

A provenance-pinned snapshot of every SAS solution currently published on
[Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:SAS): **56 tasks, 100% of
the category**. First retrieved **2026-09-08**; refreshed **2026-09-11**.

This repository is a *data corpus*, not a software project. It holds the SAS
side of Rosetta Code's "same task, many languages" canon: community-written
SAS, from classroom classics (FizzBuzz, Fibonacci, N-queens, Sudoku) to
genuinely statistical material (Welch's t-test, QR decomposition, P-value
correction, cumulative standard deviation). It exists so that SAS work can be
searched, diffed, cited, and fed into tooling **without scraping the wiki**.

## Quick start

```sas
/* Run any single task's solution with SAS or SAS Studio: */
%include "corpus/fizzbuzz.sas";

/* Every solution is self-contained: read the provenance header, then the code. */
```

A browsable index of all 56 tasks lives in
[`TASKS.csv`](TASKS.csv) (task → file → source URL → page revision) and is
summarized in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `corpus/` | One `.sas` file per task. Filenames are slugified task titles. |
| `TASKS.csv` | Machine-readable index: file, task title, source URL, revision, retrieval time. |
| `tools/fetch_rosetta_sas.py` | The harvest pipeline: refresh the corpus against upstream, or check it with `--check`. |
| `LICENSE` | Corpus-wide license statement (GFDL 1.2, see below). |
| `NOTICE` | Provenance & attribution appendix. |

Every `.sas` file opens with a provenance header, e.g.:

```sas
/* Source: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz
   Rosetta Code task 'FizzBuzz', page revision 410510.
   License: GFDL 1.2 (Rosetta_Code:Copyrights). Retrieved 2026-09-08T14:05:03Z. */
```

The **page revision ID** is the important part: it pins each file to the exact
revision of the wikitext it was extracted from, so any file is reproducible and
auditable against upstream.

## License and provenance

The SAS text in this corpus originates from [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org),
which is published under the **GNU Free Documentation License 1.2**
(see [Rosetta_Code:Copyrights](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code:Copyrights)).
Individual contributors may have granted additional permissions; page history is
the authority. Accordingly:

- This collection, its headers, and this README are distributed under
  **GFDL 1.2** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) with attribution to the Rosetta Code
  project and the individual task authors.
- Each file preserves its own provenance so downstream reuse can attribute
  correctly. See [`NOTICE`](NOTICE.md).
- This is a **point-in-time snapshot** of a wiki; upstream content is licensed
  by its contributors, not by this repository.

If you redistribute, modify, or build on these files, keep the provenance
headers attached and reproduce this notice.

## Status and caveats

- **Community probe material, not verified gold.** Nothing here is a
  correctness claim until it has been executed and checked. Contributions may
  be partial, illustrative, or platform-specific (Base SAS vs. SAS/IML vs.
  SAS Studio).
- **Multiple examples per task are kept in one file**, separated by numbered
  comment banners (`/* --- task: example 1 of 2 --- */`).
- **Code-block language labels are not reliable upstream**; code inside a SAS
  section is captured regardless of its `lang=` label (PROC IML has shipped as
  `lang=text`, PROC SQL as `lang=sql`).

## Lineage

This corpus is the SAS material layer of a pair. The sibling repository,
[sas-campaign](https://github.com/the-pgh-cid/sas-campaign), carries the migration
toolchain and documents the shared origin of the concept: a 2018
statistical-agency wiki of side-by-side SAS, R, and Python examples built to
move statistical work onto open languages, which itself names
[Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org) (2007) as related prior work. The
full citation lives in the sibling's Origins section.

The roles differ by design. sas-campaign proves SAS semantics with executable
gates and receipts; sas-ref preserves the community corpus that tooling
is exercised against, pinned to source so it can be cited without scraping
the wiki.

## Refresh

The snapshot is reproducible with the harvest pipeline in this repository:

```sh
python3 tools/fetch_rosetta_sas.py --check   # report drift; exit 1 if any
python3 tools/fetch_rosetta_sas.py           # refresh corpus/ and indexes
```

The pipeline enumerates the `Category:SAS` members, fetches each task's
wikitext, and extracts the `{{header|SAS}}` sections. A refresh is faithful
and minimal: unchanged files keep their original retrieval stamps, changed
pages are re-extracted with the fetched revision, and `TASKS.csv` plus
`TASKS.md` are regenerated in the same pass. `--check` writes nothing and
exits non-zero when the repository is not current, so it doubles as a drift
alarm. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) before touching generated files
by hand.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): briefly: prefer a PR per task,
keep provenance headers intact, and mark any additions that are *yours*
(not re-scraped) clearly.

## Governance

This repository is governed under the
[drift-management-framework](https://github.com/the-pgh-cid/drift-management-framework)
(DMF 2.0), file-based governance for projects worked on by humans and agents
together. The contract is [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); the machine-readable
descriptor is [`agent-manifest.json`](agent-manifest.json), validated against
[`agent-manifest.schema.json`](agent-manifest.schema.json) in CI; and the
invariants are checked by
[`scripts/inertia-drift-lint`](scripts/inertia-drift-lint) on every push:
fences, pointers, manifest shape, status lines, and the style floor of no em
dashes and no ellipses in artifacts.
